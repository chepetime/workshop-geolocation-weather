# Workshop: Weather Geolocation

In this workshop we build a weather app with geolocation.

> Based on Enlight's [Build a Geolocation Weather App](https://enlight.nyc/weather#project)

<br><br>

## Install

Install project pependencies with `npm`:

```sh
npm install
```

> You need to install Node.js, the latest version should do. You can also install `nvm` for handling your node versions.

Then, start the development server:

```sh
npm run start
```

This task is defined in the `package.json` file. Check it out if you want!
